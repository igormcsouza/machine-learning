# Machine Learning

I'm trying to solve a big problem, using nlp-algorithms to solve operational-research problems such as bin-packing and traveller salesman problem. Some people are trying to solve this, and I'm one of them. Instead of running the prior code, I will fill this repository out with a bunch of machine-learning algorithms, so I could grow in knowledge and save some ideas for the future.
