# Machine Learning to solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems

I'm trying to adress a big problem, using nlp-algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as bin-packing and traveller salesman problem. Many are struggling to solve problems like these, I'm one of them. Instead of running the prior code, I will fill this repository out with a bunch of machine-learning algorithms, so I could grow in knowledge and save some ideas for the future.
